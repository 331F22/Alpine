## Creative Objectives
Description: Group 5 wished to create a means to sort through the accepted volunteers within the platform, and to create a whitelisting/blacklisting system that will provide further safety to physical members of the foundation. Blacklisting certain members, banning individuals, is a way to regulate the safety of people in the foundation and would help to regulate members who could be a danger to others. The whitelist/blacklist system will delegate everyone to the whitelist category, and when someone recieves enough complaints the admin can easily blacklist, with proper reason, when it is needed at the foundation.
