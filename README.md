## Creative Objectives
Description:<br> 
&emsp;Group 5 wished to create a means to sort through the accepted volunteers within the platform, and to create a whitelisting/blacklisting system that will provide further safety to physical members of the foundation. Blacklisting certain members, banning individuals, is a way to regulate the safety of people in the foundation and would help to regulate members who could be a danger to others. The whitelist/blacklist system will delegate everyone to the whitelist category, and when someone recieves enough complaints the admin can easily blacklist, with proper reason, when it is needed at the foundation.

    - Personal Work: I work as the archivist and Back-End developer for Group 5's project. I work specifically with detailing the presentation, archiving any resources or tools used in the project, refreshing the meetings and documentation, and working on the Back-End Express code. The work I do involves rigourous checks on the spelling and correctness of our documentation, while also preparing the group for presentations and meetings. Back-End development involves making sure that our DB connects to our page and properly updates with the columns and correct format. Additionally, my Back-End development involves the linkage of any resources that have update or creation modifications to the DB.

## Conclusion
Description:<br>
&emsp;The developments of Group 5 are done in association, and under the guidance, with Montana State Universities professors, teacher assistants, and online resources provided to the student body. The following acknowledges the assistance that these listed items have given for the overall success of Group 5's task.
<br>
&emsp;Group 5 has developed an Admin access, and unique, blacklist whitelist page for quick banning usage for the BSF entity. The page acts as a clean and unique view for administrators to view all blacklisted individuals, or to blacklist individuals that have recieved many complaints, and or, issues on the grounds of BSF. Group 5 feels we have learned more about the world of Javascript, React, and Express. The group took multiple tools, as listed above, and were able to use a database to access an archive of volunteers and sort them into proper listings. The feature developed took much time to develop, but is a simple tool that implements extra functionality in a select area for any administrator. The Group worked hard to achieve the overall goal of the project and bring it to a working level for future usage. Thus concludes the work done by Group 5 of CSCI 331.
